# Portfolio Website

## Project Description

Hello! This is the repository of my portfolio website, which I created to showcase myself as a frontend developer. This project is designed to present my skills and highlight my projects and achievements. The portfolio website aims to provide visitors with a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic GitHub Repositories**: The project fetches my latest repositories using the GitHub API and displays an overview of my coding projects for visitors.
- **Discord Integration**: The website also integrates with Discord and checks my online status. This feature allows visitors to know if I am available for collaboration or communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies enable me to create responsive and interactive web pages.
- **Backend**: I have not used any specific backend technologies for this project. The portfolio website relies solely on frontend technologies, ensuring a lightweight and fast structure.

## Conclusion

My portfolio website represents my dedication to frontend development and my passion for creating engaging web experiences. It showcases my skills and projects, demonstrating my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.

You are welcome to explore the repository and reach out to me for any inquiries or collaboration opportunities.
